They are quite unprofessional and annoying and they might push away some good clients. Please put that into consideration. Thanks. Not happy, borrowed twice and paid before the due date and when I needed a third time they rejected without explanation or giving me an option for a lower amount. Customer service sucks no replies just computer generated texts. Not good if you have an emergency. Bad loan app. Repeated calls that are so annoying. Even after paying they still call and send text messages many hours after. Also very high, exorbitant and predatory interest rates. Would not recommend to anyone. It's a good app provided you keep the time line of the payment duration. The area I have issues is receiving calls by your system. Some of us receive calls from our customers for service so when your system immediately call I peak assuming it's client only to hear reminder from you. So try to control that and you will become friendly staff. Thanks 🙏 They give you the cash but a day later annoying unending robot calls reminding you to pay. The most annoying thing about this app is that even after you have paid the loan, their unqualified personnel will still send you threatening texts before even verifying if you had cleared the loan balance. A good loan app but they really encourage you to default by endless texts and calls. \",\n",

The application process is very fast, I don't need a lot of paperwork and the best thing is that you can get large amounts in moments, best of all are very low interest!!! I recommend this application even more to Peruvians! I wouldn't recommend this app. Submitted my information, and applied, now it's 5 days the app still shows under review. They don't answer phone calls and the online messaging within the app is unattended to, no one replies to the messages you send them yet they claim to reply within 2 hours. Unreliable people these are. Excellent application, they are quite punctual in payments, they can get anyone out of any problem, the disbursement is quite fast. I'm a senior citizen and it didn't complicate me in any way, because it's too simple steps and it's not delayed, I could do it from home, because I walk in a wheelchair and it's complicated to get around in those wheelchairs. I have applied for loans on other loan apps and nothing compares to this app, called GetLoan! To me, this is the best app I could find. I recommend it 100%, I really like knowing that I have an app that is made to get super fast and reliable loans, when you apply for a loan you realize that their process is very good, they don't ask you for so many applications, and it is really worth it! I needed to pay my son's dance allowance urgently, but I was unemployed at the time and had to cover basic needs such as food and accommodation. I was told about the app and started installing it and when I checked I had the money in my account, it was super easy and quick, the disbursement took place in less than 24 hours. \",\n",

Am paying your loan and uninstalling this app immediately.

Any way it's very inconvenient to do that. It's easy to apply but before you get the loan it's something else like for me I have always tried to apply for almost one month now and there is no positive feedback So far so good, my first loan was fast was requested to pay and get an increase in my limit, it happened instantly. it's a great app, sorted me out in a very short time, interest is manageable. Keep up the good work. Amazing and fast, brief yet straight to the point, can spare you time compared to a shyloc or unlicensed lender, nice services and customer oriented ,satisfactory and I believe there are no complains .It is nice to do business and the customer or lender/ applicants get a reason to smile during such tough times.

       "   'comments': \"I have used Tala loan and it's good in such a way the services are good if you request a loan you get it instantly, the interest is very low and it's a reducing balance , if you pay the loan balance, you can apply another one on the same day so you can't get stuck,and no guarantees nor security needed, it's sooo good to everyone in need of finance to boost business,thanks It's good and very reliable. I love it. I have tried it because I needed money to boost my business and for sure it has come through for me. The procedures are not much and can be cleary seen as true. Thank tala for accepting my request I hope everyone just chooses this loan app. you just helped me when I was stuck. The loan repayment period is also flexible and very reliable. The interest is also not high compared to other loan apps they take short time to allocate the loan. Very efficient, very reliable, customer friendly, pocket-friendly interest rates and convenient repayment period based on your ability. I highly recommend it to any interested borrower. Tala all the time! *TALA, THE BEST FOREVER!* It's good... Try doing away with the payment charges by opting for a till number instead of a paybil number which further increases the cost of the loan unnecessarily...! Another option would be simply linking your bank account for direct deposit from our mpesa when we are paying back loans ... Love it. Best loan app. Low interest rates and loan processed and distbursed instantly. Very reliable. Now enjoying the Gold limit. And one can choose the repayment time that they are comfortable with. \",\n",
